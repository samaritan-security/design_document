## 5. Testing



### 5.1 Aspects of Samaritan Security that will be tested to validate correctness of project:

Samaritan uses Python Unittest and React's *insert framework name here* to validate the correctness of Samaritan. 

#### 5.1.1 Python Unittest

- API tests
  - Confirms databases work as intended through CRUD operations
  - Validates response Status Codes 
  - Validates contents of responses
  - Validates functionality of the API
 
- Facial recognition tests
  - Validates that the facial recognition works under numerous circumstances
  - Validates facial comparisons from "known" database
  - Validates TimeoutQueue is working 

- Blur detection tests
  - Detects blurry images through tests

- Usage of multiple cameras at once (Multiple camera tests)
  - Runs tests on different camera feeds and validates facial encodings

#### 5.1.2 React testing





### 5.2 Hardware and Software 

### 5.3 Functional Testing

### 5.4 Nonfunctional Testing
